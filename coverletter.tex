\cvsection{Cover Letter}
Dear Hiring Team, % Preferably use the hiring manager's name if known.
\medskip

The opening paragraph is your chance to catch the hiring manager’s attention, introduce yourself and express your enthusiasm to a potential employer. Include why you’re excited about the job and the company and how it lines up with your career goals. Include keywords from the job posting and match your skills to the employer’s requirements. If you were referred to this job by someone who knows the hiring manager or already works at this company, you may want to mention this referral in your opening paragraph.
\medskip

Use the middle paragraph to discuss your most relevant experience, highlighting specific qualifications and skills that make you the perfect candidate. In one or two paragraphs, make the connection between your previous accomplishments and your suitability for the role you are applying for. Think of these paragraphs as a way to pitch yourself as the ideal match for the role. 
\medskip

Use the final paragraph to thank the employer for their time and consideration and clarify any details from your resume. For example, if you have employment gaps because you were caring for a sick loved one, you can briefly mention this here. You can also use this space to sum up your qualifications for the role and express an interest in continuing to the next stage in the hiring process.
