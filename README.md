# Resume Template

How it looks:

> Insert files here

### How to use

Download the template files, edit, zip and upload to [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).

To customize colors and theme: Edit `styles.cls` and modify the color properties

Feel free to move sections up and Down. There are some more commands defined in the `styles.cls` file which I have not used by default.

All the best for the job hunt!
